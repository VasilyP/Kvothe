        <p><em>“It's the questions we can't answer that teach us the most. They teach us how to think. <br>
          If you give a man an answer, all he gains is a little fact. But give him a question and he'll look for his own answers.”</em></p>

          <p>"I have been called Kvothe the Bloodless, Kvothe the Arcane, and Kvothe Kingkiller. I have earned those names.
            Bought and paid for them.
            <br> But I was brought up as Kvothe. My father once told me it meant "to know."
            <br>I have, of course, been called many other things. Most of them uncouth, although very few were unearned.
            <br>I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings.
            <br>I burned down the town of Trebon.
            <br>I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life.
            <br>I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in.
            <br>I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day.
            <br>I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep.
            <br><br>You may have heard of me."</p></td>
